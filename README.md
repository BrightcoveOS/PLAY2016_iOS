# PLAY2016_iOS
iOS Demo apps presented at the Brightcove PLAY 2016 conference.

## Visit The [Play Conference](https://play.brightcove.com) Website


These small apps show how to set up and use the Brightcove Player SDK. Frameworks are already included in the projects, so there is nothing else you need to download.

Xcode 7.0+ is required.

Note: in each of the sample projects, you should modify `main.m` with your own account IDs so that you can retrieve and play actual media.

The account ID is your Video Cloud account number.
The Policy Key is used to set restrictions, if any, on playback. Follow this link for more information about how to get a policy key: [Policy Keys](http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/player-management/guides/policy-key.html).

Look in the Media section of your Video Cloud account for the Playlist ID of your video playlist.

The PlayTwo application also requires FreeWheel credentials, which you can get from your FreeWheel account manager, if you have one.
